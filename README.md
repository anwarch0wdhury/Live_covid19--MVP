# Android MVP Architecture Demo (Kotlin + Retrofit)
Here I am developing a Demo `Covid 19 Information` Android App with `MVP Architecture` using `Kotlin` language and `Retrofit` network calling library.
### Project Description
We will develop a Covid 19 information  Android Application with MVP architecture. 
The UI will be as like as below screenshot. 
There are three bottom navigation bar options- 1. Check, 2. Home, 3. Information. 
Home- user can see the list of the whole world and their coronavirus update. 
There is a search option user can search by country name. 
Check- User can have an idea if he/she is affected by any Coronavirus symptoms. 
Information - User can know information about COVID 19.
Used Picasso library to load the photos of the flag. 
Used Pi chart graph to displaying data.
Converted Last_updated data Unix Timestamp to human-readable date-time.
Checked network connection on run time.
(Api of this app is used only for practice)
